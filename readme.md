# Space Friends

Ongoing single page app that renders space friends flying around doing stuff.
Typescript, React, canvas state machines, and so many space friends!

- Vite for building
- React Router for navigation
- Excaliber JS for the canvas game rendering
- Fully navigatable by keyboard
- Tested with React Testing Library

## The Simulation:

Clicking on the name of a laborer, pirate, shop, etc will take you to their journal.

### Laborers

Laborers go to work to earn stuff. When they have enough stuff they go home and spend their stuff. When they are out of stuff they go back to work.

### Pirates

Pirates will pick a random laborer and chase them. Pirates will if flee if they get too close to a space shop.

### Space Shop

Space shops give stuff to laborers for their time. They are always open (for now!)

### Homes

Homes take stuff from laborers for their time. They are always cozy.
